    "If we want to search for an element `e` in the list, we can do so **sequentially**, where we search from the 1st element up to the last element from the list, if we find `e` while searching through, then return `True`, else if we reached to the end of the list and there is no `e` found, then return `False`. We can also return the index of `e` if we found it."
